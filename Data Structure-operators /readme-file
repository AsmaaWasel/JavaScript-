The main topics covered in this JavaScript code are:

ðŸ‘‰ Looping: It demonstrates the use of loops to iterate over arrays and objects, such as looping over the scored array to print each player's name and goal number, and looping over the odds object to print odds.

ðŸ‘‰ Object manipulation: The code interacts with JavaScript objects extensively, accessing values using dot notation and square brackets, iterating over object entries, and dynamically accessing property names.

ðŸ‘‰ Array manipulation: It utilizes array methods like entries() to get both index and value during iteration.

ðŸ‘‰ Conditional statements: Conditional logic is employed to handle special cases, such as checking if the team is a draw or victory and adjusting the output accordingly.

ðŸ‘‰ Bonus task - Object creation: It demonstrates creating and populating an object dynamically (scorers object) based on the data provided.

ðŸ‘‰ Basic arithmetic operations: It performs arithmetic operations to calculate the average of odds.
