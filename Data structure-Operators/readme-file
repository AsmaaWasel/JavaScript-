Certainly! This JavaScript code takes input from a <textarea> element containing variable names in underscore_case format. When a button is clicked, the code processes each line of input, converts the underscore_case variable names to camelCase, and logs the converted names along with a number of âœ… symbols corresponding to the number of words in each variable name. The code achieves this by manipulating strings, utilizing DOM methods for interaction, employing looping constructs, and utilizing various string and array methods for string manipulation and iteration.
